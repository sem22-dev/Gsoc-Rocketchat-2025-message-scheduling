![google-summer-of-code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/assets/media/logo.svg)

**Implement a native message scheduling feature for Rocket.Chat to enhance global collaboration.**

I worked on a project to implement a native message scheduling feature for Rocket.Chat, enabling users to schedule messages for optimal delivery across time zones. 

This repository serves as the final report summary of my GSoC 2025 project and a guide for future contributors.

## ‚≠ê Project Abstract

Rocket.Chat users across multiple time zones need a way to schedule messages for optimal delivery, enhancing global collaboration. This project implemented a native message scheduling feature by integrating a scheduling UI, a cron job to send messages at the designated time, and a contextual bar UI to view and cancel scheduled messages.

## üö¢ Deliverables

- **Core Functionality**:
  - Users can schedule messages via a seamless UI ( a clock icon just near the send button)
  - A cron job (`sendScheduledMessages`) reliably sends messages at the designated time.
  - A contextual bar UI allows users to view, edit, and cancel scheduled messages.
- **MongoDB Collection**: A `ScheduledMessages` model to store scheduled messages.
- **APIs**:
  - `chat.scheduleMessage`: Schedule a new message.
  - `chat.getScheduledMessages`: Retrieve scheduled messages.
  - `chat.cancelScheduledMessage`: Cancel a scheduled message.
  - 'chat.updateScheduledMessage
- **pages and Modals User Interfaces**:
  - `ScheduleComposerModal`: Modal for scheduling messages.
  - `ScheduledMessagesPage`: Dedicated page for managing scheduled messages.
  - `DeleteScheduledMessageModal` and `EditScheduledMessageModal`: Modals for deleting and editing scheduled messages.
- **Cron Job**: Handles scheduled message delivery with robust logging.
- **Internationalization**: Updated localization files for multilingual support.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for scheduling and sending messages.
- **Documentation and Tests**: Comprehensive documentation and unit tests for APIs and cron jobs.

## Demo

### Screenshots

Below are screenshots demonstrating the message scheduling feature:

1. **Scheduling UI Button**: The scheduling button in the message composer, accessible next to the send button.

2. **Schedule Composer Modal**: Clicking the scheduling button opens the `ScheduleComposerModal`, allowing users to select a date and time for message delivery.

3. **Success Toast Notification**: After confirming the schedule, a toast notification confirms the message has been scheduled successfully.

## Current State

- **Completed**:
  - Core scheduling functionality, APIs, and UIs are fully implemented and merged upstream.
  - The cron job reliably sends scheduled messages.
  - Error handling ensures robust operation.
- **Not Implemented**:
  - Thread support for scheduling messages in threads.
  - Image attachment support for scheduled messages.
- **Merged Upstream**: All core deliverables are merged into the Rocket.Chat main repository.
- **Pending**:
  - Additional testing for edge cases.
  - Enhancements like thread and image support.

## What's Left to Do

- **Thread Support**: Extend scheduling to support messages in threads, requiring updates to the `ScheduledMessages` model and APIs.
- **Image Attachments**: Allow scheduling messages with images, integrating with Rocket.Chat‚Äôs file upload system.
